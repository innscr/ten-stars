# TenStarsMovies

**TenStarsMovies** is a web application for searching and rating movies, using the external [OMDb API (Open Movie Database)](https://www.omdbapi.com). The project allows users to quickly find interesting films and manage their own list of watched titles.

## Features

- **Movie Search**  
  Users can type a query into the search field on the left side of the screen, which displays a list of matching movies fetched from the OMDb API. On the right side, the number of results is shown to help navigate available titles. If a movie is not found, a “Movie not found” message is displayed.

- **Movie Details**  
  When a movie is selected from the list, detailed information such as description, runtime, and other data from the API appears on the left side of the screen.
