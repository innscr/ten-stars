# TenStarsMovies

**TenStarsMovies** is a web application for searching and rating movies, using the external [OMDb API (Open Movie Database)](https://www.omdbapi.com). The project allows users to quickly find interesting films and manage their own list of watched titles.

## Features

- **Movie Search**  
  Users can type a query into the search field on the left side of the screen, which displays a list of matching movies fetched from the OMDb API. On the right side, the number of results is shown to help navigate available titles. If a movie is not found, a “Movie not found” message is displayed.

- **Movie Details**  
  When a movie is selected from the list, detailed information such as description, runtime, and other data from the API appears on the left side of the screen.

- **Rating Movies**  
  Users can rate movies by hovering over the star bar and selecting the desired number of stars. After rating, the option to add the movie to the watched list becomes available.

- **Watched Movies List**  
  In the **"Movies you watched"** section, users can view a summary of all rated and watched films. Each entry shows the average user rating, individual rating, and the runtime of the movie.
